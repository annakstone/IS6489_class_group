# Introduction

This project is to create a model to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. The testing and training data consists of 1,460 observations and contains 79 explanatory variables. By using all or some combination of variables in the data to find what buyers are looking for and the estimated price for each home.   

The predictive model developed in this notebook will utilize 13 out of the 79 available variables. We combined the predictors using a mixture of additive and interaction methods to enhance the model's performance. A list of variables selected are in the explaination of the variables section. 

# Description of Data

```{r}
# Check for NAs
na <- colSums(is.na(train))
na[na > 0]
```

**Missing Data**

These values are legitimately missing and will be imputed with the median from the respective variable. 

- **LotFrontage**: 259 values
- **Electrical**: 1 value
- **MasVnrType and MasVnrArea**: 8 values each

**NA is Meaningful**

NA is being used to encode a missing feature. These values will be replaced with "none" instead of NA. 

- **Alley**: No alley access
- **BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1, BsmtFinType2**: No Basement
- **FireplaceQu**: No Fireplace
- **GarageType, GarageYrBlt, GarageFinish, GarageQual, GarageCond**: No Garage
- **PoolQC**: No Pool
- **Fence**: No Fence
- **MiscFeature**: None

**Clean Data**

OverallQual should be factored. There is a non-linear relationship between OverallQual and SalesPrice.

Variables below were selected for their p-value significance when run agains SalePrice individually. 
1) **ExterQual**: Evaluates the quality of the material on the exterior
2) **KitchenQual**: Kitchen quality
3) **OverallQual**: Rates the overall material and finish of the house
4) **GrLivArea**: Above grade (ground) living area square feet
5) **Neighborhood**: Physical locations within Ames city limits
6) **BsmtQual**: Height of the basement
7) **TotalBsmtSF**: Total square feet of basement area
8) **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet
9) **OverallCond**: Overall condition rating
10) **YearBuilt**: Original construction date
11) **Fireplaces**: Number of fireplaces
12) **LotShape**: General shape of property
13) **GarageCars**: Size of garage in car capacity

# Cross Validation

```{r}
# Randomly sample 70% of the rows
set.seed(123)
index <- sample(x = 1:nrow(train), size = nrow(train)*.7, replace = F)

head(index) # These are row numbers

# Subset train using the index to create train_fold
train_fold <- train[index, ]

# Subset the remaining row to create validation fold.
validation_fold <- train[-index, ]
```

```{r}
# Fit example model
model <- lm(SalePrice ~ GarageCars * GrLivArea + TotalBsmtSF + BsmtQual + ExterQual + KitchenQual + OverallQual + LotArea + Neighborhood + OverallCond + YearBuilt + Fireplaces + LotShape, data = train_fold)

summary(model)

# Get predictions for the train fold
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = train_fold)

# Create functions for calculating RMSE and R-squared
rmse <- function(observed, predicted) sqrt(mean((observed - predicted)^2))

R2 <- function(observed, predicted){
  TSS <- sum((observed - mean(observed))^2)
  RSS <- sum((observed - predicted)^2)
  1- RSS/TSS
}

# Calculate RMSE and R-squared for train fold
rmse(train_fold$SalePrice, predictions)
R2(train_fold$SalePrice, predictions)
```

An average error of $30,834.83 is observed in the training fold with the model explaining about 85% of the variance in sale price. This model meets the minimum requirements and can proceed to be utilized on the validation fold. 

```{r}
# Get predictions for the validation fold
predictions.v <- predict(model, newdata = validation_fold)

# Calculate RMSE and R-squared for validation fold
rmse(validation_fold$SalePrice, predictions.v)
R2(validation_fold$SalePrice, predictions.v)
```

An average error of $26,845.4 is observed in the training fold with the model explaining about 88% of the variance in sale price. This model performs better on the validation fold and is reliable for predicting sale prices on new data.
